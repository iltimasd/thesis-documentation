# Writing Assignment
Writing Assignment due via email by 10:00am, Monday, September 17th, 2018



Find a selection of three (3) art/design precedents that you find inspiring and that relate to your current interests/explorations for thesis. In addition to representative visuals for each precedent, I suggest looking for video and/or printed interviews of the artists/designers, so that you can reflect on and respond to actual statements made by the creators of your selected precedents. Sources for videos could be TED talks or Art21 documentaries among many other sources. In addition to general web searches, donâ€™t forget about the wealth of resources (journals, magazines, etc.) available at our library and e-library...



Write a two-page discursive reflection on your concept and intention for thesis so far, as well as a reaction to your selected design/art precedents. Include visuals for each precedent as well any relevant web links. Images/links should be included on subsequent pages to the two-page written assignment. 



Write a list of (minimum) five design values that relate to your current thesis concept. These should be single words, not sentences.



Some questions to think about your thesis work: What themes/directions are emerging?

Some questions to think about your chosen precedents: What is most inspiring to you? Most meaningful? What is missing? What approaches could you explore to expand/improve your chosen precedents?

For my thesis, I'm interested in looking into police surveillance and what citizens can do to combat their surveillance. A lot of what I'm currently thinking about is framed by the Stephen Graham book, "Cities Under Siege: The New Military Urbanism". In the book, Graham shows how the new military doctrine takes cities in the Global South as a prototyping grounds for systems of surveillance oppression to then bring back to the cities of the Global North. With the idea that enemies of the state are using cities as areas of anonymity, the state must heavily surveil cities as though they are active battlegrounds. This new 4th generation of war is what drives my work: What are the tools of counter surveillance when citizens of cities have been escalated, against their will, to the status of combatants? I have to finish the book/order it on Amazon, but I am interested in further exploring how guerilla warfare and insurgency plays a role in Global North conflicts, as I'm sure they are important. Another aspect, I'm interested, particularly around US policing, is flipping the script of surveilling citizens to find/combat terrorists to surveilling police to find/combat "the bad apples".

I have been struggling with how to approach this for thesis, however I've identified three routes in how I might tackle this domain.

The first would be to write a guide book, a sort-of rules of engagement and/or military strategy for the newly deemed combatant. In this lens, I look towards Ingrid Burrington's book, Networks of New York. Burrington's book is akin to field guides you might take on a hike to identify flora and fauna. However in this book, instead of flora and fauna, it's wireless routers and manhole covers. I think what I find most inspiring to me about Burrington's book is that it is able to shed light on internet infrastructure in an accessible way. Though I'm currently conceptualizing the project as a sort of war manual, perhaps the final product needs to be packaged in a friendlier and approachable way. 

The second is building a set of tools to actively combat against surveillance. In this light, I would like to explore using systems of policing on the police themselves. Much like in the practice of sousveillance, where the surveilled surveil the surveillers, I'd like to extend that to other tools. For example how could we use ML and facial recognition in sousveillance. Additionally, are there tools that can take advantage of other "fronts" of combat. What are the tools for legal combat? Social/morale combat? Economic combat? In this route, I've looked towards the work of Adam Harvey. A portion of Harvey's work are tools, objects, and guides to combat surveillance, and often facial recognition software. Two projects in particular that are of interest are HyperFace and CV Dazzle. The former is a bandana that has a pattern that triggers false positives for facial recognition. The latter is a system of hair and makeup techniques to obscure the face to prevent generating a match for facial recognition. I find inspiration in these 2 projects as they integrate fashion and lifestyle in its effort to combat surveillance. If I were to follow this path for thesis, I'd like the extend Harvey's work perhaps in a more "McGyver", DIY approach to combatting surveillance.

The last would be a speculative design project. I've recently been introduced and thinking about speculative justice and police futures. I had briefly explored this idea for [a small assignment in  my Junior year Fall semester.](https://medium.com/@iltimasdoha/handbook-for-nypd-ta-7d53ab55182c) In that project, I thought about schools as a plausible site of surveillance for the NYPD. For this route, I've done some cursory research on Alix Gerber. I find Gerber's Speculative Justice very inspiring. Firstly, Gerber integrates restorative justice into the systems laid out in Speculative Justice; I'd like to explore more where the intersection of restorative justice and combatting surveillance lies. Second, I find many of these items and systems in very plausible range. While the skinning allows users to imagine and world build around these systems, I feel the content itself is ready for prototyping in the real world. I hope this thesis can integrate an aspect of practicality.
