# Midterm Thesis Critique
---
my previous works and interests lie in police surveillance and how citizens can navigate around it. In my work I am exploring what it means to be under surveillance, particularly in surveillance enabled by technology. Often I look to "flip the script" of surveillance, turning tools of surveillance to surveilers, in order to create moments reflection and critique.
