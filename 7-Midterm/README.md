## Writings

### 2/4
My thesis Conflict V3 has taken inspiration from many places. One of the first is Ingrid Burrington’s Networks of New York. In this book, Burrington provides a field guide to internet infrastructure in new york. Through drawings and diagrams, Burrington gives users the ability to unveil the infrastructure around us all the time. It is this ability that I am interested in exploring. How can CV3 do for AI/ML and police surveillance what Burrington has done for the Internet.

Another influence for CV3 is BIT plane by the collective Bureau of Inverse Technology. BIT Plane is a video piece where an RC plane, with a video camera attached, is flown through the research park of the Silicon Valley.The video is interspersed with text that describe some of the companies whose buildings are featured. This video piece is interesting in it aesthetic quality: it a quiet and calm piece with a slow pace; it is also interesting in its approach to sousveillance; it is boring, uninformative, and,  ultimately, banal. 

Sam Lavigne’s ICE.csv is another influence for CV3. In ICE.csv, Lavigne scrapes LinkedIn for employees of ICE agents and staff. This doxxed information is then posted on GitHub, where anyone may access the name, address, and other information of the ICE employees. While I find the piece interesting in its actionable approach, I also take it a cautionary tale. Lavigne published and open sourced the scraping technique, which was subsequently used to doxx Planned Parenthood.

In  Machine Bias Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Lauren Kirchner, and Surya Mattu, investigate how predictive justice algorithms are biased against Black people and people of color. In the sentencing process, AI algorithms are used to gauge whether or not a person will be a repeat offender. Though the investigation it was found the Black citizens with the same crime, and sometimes first time offenders, would get harsher score, and thus sentencings, than White citizens, who may already be repeat offenders.

Lastly in this project, I am looking towards Automated Inference on Criminality using Face Images. This academic paper is less of a project inspiration, but rather what my project is responding to. In this paper, the authors alleged to have designed an algorithm is able to infer the criminality of someone based solely from a portrait. This area of technology is one I hope to respond to with CV3 to hopefully communicate how scary this technology is and how it will impact us.

My previous works and interests lie in police surveillance and how citizens can navigate around it. In my work I am exploring what it means to be under surveillance. Often I look to "flip the script" of surveillance, turning tools of surveillance to surveilers, in order to create moments reflection and critique.

Conflict Version 3, addresses police and data surveillance. I aim to create a taxonomy of the posture of police officers, and engage with the bodily form of surveillance. It will be done though photographing officers and running the frames through pose estimation algorithms.

The pose estimation algorithms will then be fed into a pose forecasting model, which outputs what future poses will happen. Finally these poses will be described and ‘predicted’ by surveilled communities, whose description of the poses will appear as subtitles to the poses. The initial video, poses and subtitles, will all come together in a video piece

Currently the piece seems to be too ambiguous. While I value ambiguity in my work and will no dismiss it, I hope that the community-generated content subtitles will offer the audience an in as to what the piece is responding to. Additionally, audience members seem to want a ‘solution’ from this piece, which is not something I am looking to provide, rather it is to have viewers understand the practices, inefficiencies, and immediacy of the threat of automated policing. I am not sure that I will address this. I consider the tension of the user wanting a solution to be a strength of the piece. 

Lastly, there a technical debt to overcome, in which I still need to spin up the algorithms. I will be spending spring break getting to know AWS and running the algo.
